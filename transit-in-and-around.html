                <h2>Local Airport</h2>
                <p>Taniti is served by a small airport that can accommodate small jets and propeller planes. Taniti is
                    in the process of expanding the airport so larger jets will be able to land on the island within the
                    next few years. </p>

                <h2>Seaport</h2>
                <p>Almost all visitors arrive to Taniti by air, though some arrive on a small cruise ship that docks in
                    Yellow Leaf Bay for one night per week. Guests can enjoy the many activities that Merriton Landing
                    has to offer, or venture further into the island to experience the wild beauty of Taniti's
                    rainforests.</p>
